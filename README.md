# Bayesian Restoration of Audio Degraded by Low-Frequency Pulses Modeled via Gaussian Process

This repository contains information about the paper [Bayesian Restoration of Audio Degraded by Low-Frequency Pulses Modeled via Gaussian Process](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9238480), published on the IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Signal Processing, special issue "Reconstruction of Audio from Incomplete or Highly Degraded Observations". 

At the date of June 04th 2023, this repository contains only the audio signals evaluated in the paper. The codes of the paper were implemented in MATLABÂ®, currently being translated to Python. 

ACKNOWLEDGMENT: We thank [Paulo Antonio Andrade Esquef](https://www.lncc.br/~pesquef/) for providing the signals used in the experiment with artificially degraded signals, and the "Chopin" signal employed on the real degraded scenario.
